0,"This game is awesome. Its addicting and I love it. I've played games on Google play. Out of all of them this is the best one. I'm not sure why anyone is criticising the game and why they have to pay for some features. I'm sure that if they created a game they would want to make money on it. Or even need to keep the upkeep on it and performance or ad levels. I don't think people would want to use their own money from their regular job to keep up such a massive undertaking. They would be homeless if they did. Therefore wouldn't even get to play games such as this. You also have to remember that the only right you have in the U.S. is to spend money, and fun cost money. But n-e-ways great game guys.  "")",5
1,"Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!  ')",4

Although I would REALLY like to challenge other people and be challenged because its a good game. Rarely it would just be really slow but I think its just my phone.

6,U choose choice of card and what game you play so u can either play on your own or against others just watch what u doing as time goes past so quickly b4 u realise it! One wrong move and u cannot win so helps improve memory not to do it again!  '),5
8,"Really awesome! I loved it so much! But.... There's a downside to it. I really enjoyed playing it that I made my friends download it, but can you please make the game to where it doesn't keep eating my battery that much, because I'm a traveler person so I need my phone battery to stay up even if I played games when I'm bored.   If you're reading this, please fix this problem. Thanks!!   Sincerely,  InGame Player:  AlphaLife.  "")",5
9,"Super fun and addictive. Like it there is free play and challenge mode. Makes the game harder and harder. I also like the fact the more time you play, the more characters you unlock. Very fun.  Would recommend this game to any age but more specifically to childrens. Must have game for kids. For all the none kids, this game is a Grest wake up game to get the brain up 'n going to start the day 4.5/5  "")",5
10,"Guys this game is the best offline game I have ever played as it is toooooo much addictive. U would not believe me, firstly u would die very easily but as u play on then it would be easy to create high score. It also makes your reflexes more faster. The creators have done a great work. And people who are saying there are lots of adds are talking rubbish.  Play it!!!!!  ')",5
11,Very good game. Simple but elegant concept and very well executed.  There is so much more to this then the basic game. VooDoo really delivered on this one.   I do find it funny that the ball for no hands is a football and not a futbol.  I also think it would be cool if they add a ying yang ball for getting 69 points and a heavenly background for a near death experience.  '),4
12,"I enjoy the game, and I realise that the ads are necessary to keep the game free....BUT the advertisers don't do themselves any favours when the SAME ad is repeated ad infinitum.... It works against them....makes me less likely to take up the offer! And it is particularly annoying when they interrupt play and some ads you have to click out of, and some you need the back key! At least give some variety in the ads and consistency as to method of disposal.  "")",5
13,"Definitely play this game it is so fun! You can play with your friends and battle people it's AMAZING also it is great for doing YouTube videos on!!!!!!   But although it is a good game the lag is crazy!!  Almost Everytime I play this game it lags...Also it is sooooooooooooooo hard or join a game which your friend is on as they are mostly full. Also why are there so many updated you don't even update much. And lastly we should get a daily reward of robux per day!  "")",5
15,"Love this game I always fly through the levels within a few days of them being released so would be nice if they released more and quicker. All that's left to do for the next week or 2 until the next set of levels are released is build up gems so I have alot and the odd time you release new collectables I collect them all immediately with plenty of gems to spare. I'm not having troubles with crashing this update, finally, but I am also not purchasing things.  "")",4
16,"When it's not crashing, it's fun to play.  Sucks when it doesn't load of locks up during game play.  Also it gets expensive as you have to buy packs at $99 a pop after the 1st 2.  The game play is addicting, but no fun if you cannot afford the special offers they continue to throw in your face every time you log in.  I love final fantasy games but this particular one is a money pit!.  Not to mention the constant crashing  "")",5
19,"Good game but when you ho to get the gems for a clue it doesn't add the gems, it's says network problem....not good!!!!! Apart from that good addictive game  "")",4
20,"Im really sattisfied with thegame, even though sometimes it takes me forever and lots of lifes to pass a level. But as everyone, judging by the comments i see submitted after the latest update, the game now stucks on the intro of the knitting challenge. After the dialogues are over i just see a part of the house, austin going around, screen unaible to move around and no game buttons. Please fix that soon. It would be a same to uninstall given that i am on level 252.  ')",4
21,"I absolutely LOVE it! ÄÅ¸ËÆ   Its relaxing and the words aren't too hard, its a great time killer and its fun usually I don't like these kind of games but this one I do.

22,"Very good game overall, we'll put together. Animations are smooth. Very familiar character lines. Funny boss fighting sequences. Love all the middle fingers you throw up by tapping the screen as fast as possible. You can tell this isn't just a cash grab game they give you all the major things you need for free and frequently enough where your not always hurting for more. So yeah I'd download this if you love trailer park boys as much as I do :D very good time killer  "")",5
23,"Far too many ads that take too long to view. Making the app for a reasonable price to purchase ad-free would be great.  The game itself is great, & a fun way to relax & keep your mind sharp at the same time.  ')",5
25,"this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It's so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It's just so addicting and I can't get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the 'play online' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated.

28,"Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don't like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option  "")",4

32,"I love it. It is a really fun game to play when your bored. Very good graphics and so many songs to choose from. By the way has anyone found the song 'faded' by Alan walker cause I can't find it. It would really help if someone could help me. Anyways you should definitely get the game to test your speed and you will get really good at it. Hopefully you will give it a five star cause you defiantly should. If you have read this far, thank you and have a great day. Like if you agree with my comment  "")",5
33,"The graphics are good, the controls are immersive...dont feel bad about why i gave only 4 stars because once i played in the tournament mode and the guidelines of the opponent was pointing in a different direction while when he is hitting a ball, it is automatically going parralel towards a pocket. It happened only once; looked like the opponent was hacking the game. He was potting all of the balls like that, and there was also full network. If you can fix it, then the game can be improved.

36,"There are just too many ads and some are inappropriate, e.g. ""Episode"".  The timing of the ads are also very annoying.  The colours are bright, the colour combinations and the flashing colours don\'t work well on the eyes.  ')",4
37,This game is one of the best games I played. It does need some skill and time to get good at it. I think it deserves 5 stars. You can remove ads for free by simply turning off wifi.  '),5
38,"I love Animal Crossing in all its varying forms. This game is fun, but rapidly hits its limits. After accomplishing the stretch goals...that's it. No more stretch goals are refreshed or given. You do get daily goals, but they are really simple. I am on level 50, and I play occasionally to get the new animals. I wish there was higher, unique prizes in exchange for the rare bugs and fish. All in all, it's a fun game but rapidly grows stale.  "")",5
40,"I love the concept of the game, it's awesome. I recommend it if you like upgrading games. The only thing is I would like to see more out of this game. Not talking about bugs or new fixes, I just want some new stuff in this game.  I love it. One last thing is when I shut the game game down I don't earn as much as I do if I leave my phone on? Not really sure what that is, but it's not a huge deal just would like it to be considered in the next update. Thank you!!!  "")",5
42,Best game played after a while.. Graphics are amazing.. Gameplay is good too... Controls are responsive and easy to use... Minor lags that needs to be fixed.....

44,"Many games say they are free to play but you are limited as how far you can go without putting money into the game as long as you grind and have patience as takes time. . GoH is not like that. You can actually gain the better gear, the better characters, etc without dropping buckets of money in the game. All you need to do is regularly play the game, level up your character,and participate. Doing so you will get stronger characters.

I have been so incredibly impressed with Scattered and Era, that the bar is rather high I must admit! I guess I feel like these slots are child-like, or made for kids rather than appealing to my senses!ÄÅ¸Ëï¿½  I'm gonna give it some more time and levels, but no money!!! We'll go from there!!!

48,"Update: I previously paid for this game remove the adds. Three game recently updated, and I'm stuck with adds again. Not cool, game. Not cool!  I like this game. No limits to how many rounds you can play. No fb nagging your friends. Fun and simple. Would pay a buck or two to remove adds if that were an option.  "")",4
49,"Awesome. It's almost like the old pc version. But it could get expensive to add/buy items. I wish there was a flat price version with its own package and a option   that gives you the whole game with the choice of the customer been able to pick the extras they want (like it's done now ).

53,"Awesome Game!! Really I like this game. I dont even have words to describe it. Totally Fantastic... Whatever you say, this is totally cool. But I have a request...please add a column of legendary bikes. Like there is Common, Rares, Epics, and Specials , there should be a column of legendary. Waiting eagerly for the next update. Thanks a lot of making this fabulous game. And I would also like to appreciate the colours and graphics of this game. Thanks to the team for making this game.

55,"I love shooting pool and I have played many video pool games but this one is about the closest it comes to playing the real game.  The only thing that makes it a bit harder is the setup,  aiming and shooting.  It would be great if you could move around the table and look and your shots at different angles, and be able to extend the sight line so that you can figure you best shot better. It would be nice to be able to choose different games,  like 9 ball,  straight pool,  rotation,  etc.. That's the only reason I only gave 4 stars.  IF/when there is an upgrade with these types of improvements,  I will be very happy to give 5 stars.  I recommend this game to anybody who likes shooting pool. =)  "")",4
60,"This game of simple design is very challenging! I can't put it down! The controls are simple (single tap to change lanes), but the speed is intense! My only complaint is the automatic color change of the track. During your sphere's trek down the track, the track changes color in a ROYGBIV pattern. It's a cool effect, but the darker colors make it incredibly difficult to see.  "")",5
61,"I love this game! There's always a new challenge to participate in, along with the main gameplay. It gets progressively harder as you move up the story, no slacking here! My only complaint is that within the last few hours, a glitch had occurred where it won't let me open the game? I click the icon, and it goes to the loading screen, but nothing else happens. If y'all could please fix that so I can continue playing, I'd really associated it!

67,The last time I played this was on my Ipad last year lol. Seeing molt and nickatnyte play soo much has changed. I rated this game a 5 because it is so fun and addictive collecting free chest every 4 hour trying to get a legendary.

70,"I love this game but there are a few things I think you could add to make it even better! The majority of these ideas are features that were in fifa 15 Ultimate team (mobile). First could you please allow us to have subs/reserves to sub on in games. Another addition is replays, like on fifa 15 could you make it so we have the option to save up to 15 replays of our best goals. My last suggestion/complaint is could you please update icons, the current three have been out for nearly a month (19/01/18). Great game anyway.  ')",5

This is by far the best game I have ever played, and I've played a lot of them. What you do in this game is you go down a hill and try to catch llamas.  You jump over rocks, do flips, ride on flag lines (I think that's what they're called)and catch your llamas.  There is also a zen mode which is my favorite.  The music is absolutely beautiful and relaxing, and the graphics are simple, but on the best way.  I can't describe in words how beautiful this game is.

An example of this, that happens regularly, is one player will win with a pair of 5's and confidently bet heavily on it, then you can get a pair of queens and a pair of jacks and the same player will have a full house. Just when you think you've got him or her back with a full house of your own, he or she suddenly has four of a kind.  These players will typically win five or so big hands, then leave the table.   Putting this negative aspect aside, the game-play is slick, the graphics good (well as good as you need them to be) and there are some nice features for gaining more chips to play with. One addition that would improve it, would be the option to watch ads to gain chips.

I don\'t want my massive fight to be cut out by a player saying ""NOOB!"" (I thought we left 2009...). Its annoying and absolutely horrible to have happen. On top of this, the game doesn\'t live up to what I expected. To be 100% honest, I feel as if the devolpers just added a few new maps to the 2nd game and just said, ""Good enough!"".  ')",4

The controls could do with some touch ups like when you remove your hand from the streering side it will automatically re centre which i find sometime anoying because you could be heeaded straight to a wall.

1744,"The game is thought provoking on some levels, easier on others and very, very occasionally a little tricky, possibly due to programming glitches (or my having a long day?!) on a very small number of levels. A number of reviews read negatively which is unfair. The game is entertaining and, yes, if you can't complete a level, you will have to watch an add to move on but anyone that expects to play a free game without watching adds is simply naive. I appreciate that someone took the time to think about creating these puzzles for our enjoyment. It appeals to younger and older audiences alike because of its varying levels of difficulty. I have come across the odd anomaly with not being able to pick up items, as other reviewers have reported, but ultimately this game is great value.  Anyone who says otherwise is perhaps less accepting of the fact that free merchandise may not be 100% perfect: it's free. Thanks creators for your work!  "")",4
