I\\'m not sure why anyone is criticising the game and why they have to pay for some features. I\\'m sure that if they created a game they would want to make money on it. Or even need to keep the upkeep on it and performance or ad levels. I don\\'t think people would want to use their own money from their regular job to keep up such a massive undertaking. They would be homeless if they did. Therefore wouldn\\'t even get to play games such as this. You also have to remember that the only right you have in the U.S. is to spend money, and fun cost money.
