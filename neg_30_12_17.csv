2,"It's simple, cute, and plays pretty smoothly.  It's a huge bonus that there are no ads.  Seems like there could be more focus on enjoyable gameplay over absurd obstacles to generate revenue.  The enjoyment factor drops significantly around level 190, where the game doesn't feel like a challenge so much a constant dream of luckier block falls.  I also had to earn the right to spend real money on a piggy bank, but I have no idea why it exists.  Also, no mobile game with a $100 price point deserves a good review.  "")",2
4,"It is a pretty good game, the controls r fine, the graphics look as good as the games, and the gameplay Is kinda fun. The part that I don't like about the game is that it gives you the first three levels and you have to get all the pink coins in order to get the castle. In my mind I thought that once you got all the pink coins from the castle that you could do the next world, but it turned out to be that you got the first four levels for free and had to pay to play the rest which I think sucks. But it's whatever, I'm gonna keep playing but only when I'm bored.  "")",3

8,"TOO MANY ADS  I would play this game so much more if you would make the ads just not pop up after every game. Developers I don't understand why you guys would put a no ads to buy for like a dollar but did you really have to put a video after every game. Each time it interupts the music I'm listening to on my phone. The game itself is great. 5 stars, but please tone down the ads  "")",2

I thought it was supposed to happen with Facebook but it hasn't worked. Maybe add an account option?   Update: I do still love this game. But I've reported the same issue at least 4 times and not a thing has been done about it. I have also seen that many people have had the same issue. Why does such a good app have such poor customer service.  "")",1
12,"Completely unplayable because the game is centered around taking money from you. Very poor programming, and just blatant, obvious and rank capitalism.   You can't continue unless you pay them money or else watch a 30 second ad. Every time. For real.  You people are the reason mobile gaming is complete garbage now.  And I guarantee 99% of those favorable reviews are bots.   Do not download. Scammers.  "")",1
13,"Want to play an ad? Download this game and you'll get to experience all the thrills of pop up ads between brief stints of playing the game you thought you downloaded instead of the ads. There is at least two ads per game. Some of the ads go landscape to further increase game play pleasure, X one out and Bam! Bonus round go straight to the app store to see the ad you X'ed out available for download. Go back and BAM try the X again YOU GO BACK TO THE SAME PLACE. Good times were had played ten games and uninstalled. ADWARE ten millions downloaded how many kept it longer than twenty minutes.  "")",1
16,"This is a fun little word scramble game. Straight forward easy to play. With challenging levels. I don't like that it takes 120 coins to reveal one tile - that's a bit much for how little you're rewarded for solving a level. I've played 492 levels and received over 100 coins twice during the bonus spin. The idea is that it's a random spin, with random coins rewarded but the constant reward is less than 100 coins seems kinda hokey.  All in all I like this game.  "")",3
18,"Stolen assets a-plenty. They literally have the Offspring logo on one of their boss ships. Not even kidding. They even used the Super Mario Bros level complete music in there, yet they're charging for crystals and in-game assets like ships and power ups. The game play is fun, albeit unfortunately bogged down with what seems to be a very greedy app developer's laziness and plagiarism of already established commercially trademarked and copyrighted assets. I have video of me playing this game ripped directly from my phone showing all of these issues, and will upload it to YouTube if someone takes offense. This game could have been a lot of fun, but it's literally just a cash grab. I'm tempted to report all of the copyright and trademark violations, but there are too many of them to count.  "")",1
20,"Pay to win. To make any progress it takes weeks of saving resources only to get them raided. So you have to buy gems or other resources in order to get quantities quickly enough to be used before they are stolen buy players who spend a lot of money on this game. It's a very slowly progressing game but enjoyable enough to be played without spending tons of cash if you're the patient sort.  "")",3
21,"Was loving this game until the last update. Looks like the developers love $$$ so much they would trade off user experience for it. Anyways I'm deleting it cos it's now a waste of storage on my mobile. Good luck to the premium players. It was fun giving you guys head shots in your fancy helmets. Hehehe... See you all at the next big shooting game. Much love to all the players. Thumbs down to the developers.  "")",1
22,"I was enjoying it until the day they didn't give me the golden medal and the tokens from one of the tournaments. In addition to that, they skipped one of the days I'd receive the free tokens. Guess which day that was? The day 7, in which I should have received 7 tokens. They simply skipped it and began to count again from day 1. I tried to contact the support and they didn't answer me.

28,"This game is ok. The biggest problem is that upgrading is pointless. The more you upgrade your cannon, the more the blocks upgrade, leaving games impossible to get far at all. A great game would not upgrade blocks but keep their values the same and progressively get harder as you go during a round, allowing you to get further. My games last less than 30 seconds.  ')",3
31,"I would have most definitely gave a higher rating,  if not for the type of adds that pop up every few seconds. I understand its a free game, and I can handle the adds. But every few seconds there is inappropriate adds popping up. They use really bad words. I could even handle a few cuss words but these are bad. I've never saw a game that has adds like this. My 7 year old daughter & I play together. Definitely not appropriate for kids to be playing &hearing. When the inappropriate  adds stop I'll change my rating .

33,"I realize y'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don't pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I'm pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool.

37,"It is a fun app but the ads suck. Some of the adds that pop up you cannot even close out of and it just ruins the game.

43,Someone needs to be fired or at least schooled on currency exchange rates. They offer 2 packs for 5 and 20 then except for rare sales which offer 49 and 79 dollar packs everything is 100 dollars google should step in and pull this game off the google play market for a square enix licensed product they have enough backing to have actual microtransactions not be a game exclusive to rich people who use 100 dollar bills as toilet paper...

45,"I originally reviewed this app and said that the expert level was far too simple, requiring only basic elimination techniques. That is sometimes true, and I hit a few easy ones in a row when I started. But I've since discovered that there are some genuinely challenging ones at the expert level. So I've upgraded it to four stars. Manually entering all the pencil marks is a pain sometimes, but it does make for more relaxed play. The hints are not hints, they actually fill in a square. And if you forget to turn the pencil marks on (which I do a lot) and try to enter several numbers in one square, you have to backtrack with the Undo button to restore all the pencil marks you just accidentally deleted.

49,"It seems like I\'m missing something huge here. The game is about backflips, but doesn\'t let you even jump off the ground. I tried using the starting money to purchase jump upgrades, and still resulted in belly flops every time. If the game wasn\'t plagued by 30 second ads after every other run, maybe I would have tried to figure this out. But it doesn\'t seem to actually be a game at all. The title doesn\'t fit, it should just be called ""run and fall down"".  Hopefully this gets fixed. It looked like a solid concept on the app store.  ')",1
50,"Great timewaster! There are a lot of characters to earn and you don't need to spend real money to get them, so that's a plus. However, rated it a 3 cuz there are sooooo many ads.
