3,"Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I'm just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it's going to be good.  We'll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!  "")",5

7,"I love it quite a lot but there are too many ads and NO SOUND. The only thing that happens when things blow up is your phone vibrates. And seriously, there's an ad after every single game. Fix those problems and it will be a 5/5 in my book. Also, it's a little buggy sometimes. I won't even have the game running and it will tell me it crashed.  "")",4
10,"This is a fun word game.Having played one of BitMango's other games, Word Cookies, I'm pleased this one is as enjoyable. I'm assuming it will get progressively more difficult as it progresses. Easy to play a bit, put it down, and continue the round later. Very pleased to find another relaxing game from a good company. So refreshing to play a game that doesn't hound a player for money constantly, so I don't mind parting with a bit of money for hint coins when needed. Hope they have little extra daily and weekend clallanges like they've  started for Word Cookies!  "")",5
11,"So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I'll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It's in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I've ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing.

15,"Love that the levels get more  challenging as you go on and that you can get extra words to go towards your coins. Also love the daily puzzle. You expect some ads for a free app but they are long ads that I have to x out of at least twice, and sometimes that doesn't even work and I have to push the back button on my phone or exit the game. For that I take a star off.  "")",4
17,"It\'s great to pass the time. I especially like the fact that it will get ""tired"" and force you to stop,  which I\'m sure my job appreciates ÙüèÏÊ  And there are ads but it\'s not overwhelming at all! Have downloaded games WAAAY worse on ads. This one is good.  ')",4
19,"Ok 1. This game is awesome 10/10, 2. When u reach max level its hard to get gems and everyone is pay to win. There's no way free to win can win easly. U guys start making hot offer that makes everyone buy it, and you guys totally success. But this game isnt fair anymore, people buy your offer and buy awesome Guns, tools. But the free to play cant get that stuff easy. 3. Its hard to get stuff from event that used keys. I ALWAYS got 1 gem every time i spin it. Please make this game fair. Also The game only have 1% hackers at it and im very ok with it and like it. Thanks  "")",5
23,"The game is great the features are excellent but the only problem is, is that pokemon only show up in one spot I know you have to out and about to find them but it would be nice to be able to move my character in the pokemon world. And it would be nice to actually update the scenery as well so it's not just a grass land area. You need to add say like pokemon centres and contests and other building and characters you can bump into to talk to. But other than that it's a great game and I do love playing.  "")",5
24,"When I was quite young around 5 to 6 years old I used to play the orginal version,it used to be my favourate. And now even as I am only nine TEMPLE RUN2 has come to my life as an improved version of Temple run. I can say it is even better as we don't have to give money to reach the frozen  level or whatever it is called, and the greatest part of the game is that there are no ads at all (by that I mean there may be two or three but i am sure not more than that)and to anybody who wants to know this ,there are Prizes and spinning wheels.

27,"This game is perfect with my Samsung galaxy note8. Fun to play. Easier to play with the stylus s pen. I recently broke my s pen, yet it still works, but I try to  limit its use so I don't break it further. This game is easy to learn, and gets challenging. Helps Kitchen is what I'm at right now, and its free hard! Only at level 8 with two stars. Always try to get three.

30,"You guys have an awesome game here. For a mobile shooter game i feel like this has all the elements a game needs. Its all skill, you can only buy asthetics (costumes, gun skins, etc.) Every game is different cause your equipment depends on what you find on the map and where you drop from the helicopter at. You are gathering people together 90 to 100 a game and have the option of solo or 2,4 and 5 man squads. With the capabilities to chat with the phone mic... this game has amazing potential. Just a few kinks  in my opinion.  Great start to what i hope will be a sensation.  ')",5
32,"Great game. Nice mix of action and turn based play. The fact that you can search for specific shards, gear, crafting parts is a touch of genius - no grind. Separate energy for two areas means longer play. Only downside is the rating for this is not high enough! Also, background music changes according to location, very nice detail. Massive amount of characters and variations of them. Great game guys. Really looking forward to updates.  ')",5
35,"The ads when I play an episode. I have to watch at least 2-3 adds before every episode other than the first free one that doesn't take a ticket. I would love it if the tickets refilled in 1 hour or less instead of like, 3... other than that, it's really great and all the different episodes.

59,"mazingly fun This game is really fun! The graphics are great, and the gameplay too. However, I have a suggestion for you. Can you make an online two player mode for this, like if one dies, the other can find other pieces of sausage to revive their friend. Or even a competitive mode were you tap multiple times to gain as much speed as possible, and then run into each other, like jousting. Those are just two things off of the top of my head.

64,"No offline mode definitely hurts this title! *Took two stars off because there is no offline mode thus requiring a constant Internet connection to play. Not really on the go if your tablet or cell phone does not have a active cellular data connection (for little kids this is kind of an issue). Moving on..   This is a great reminder that Nintendo is first and foremost a software company, and an amazing one at that. This game's visuals are awesome, the gameplay is super fun, the sound design is second to none. 9.99 is a premium price for a mobile game, but this title is definitely worth it.  "")",4

71,Its amazing and highly addictive. Actually one of the few games that not only hold my attention but my kids as well. The only two issues I have is when lag strikes its basically impossible to play conssidering your hand takes up part of the screen anyway. Then every time you die you have to close out of an add. Which if you have a curved screen some of those are hard to close out of.  It would be really cool if in addition to building your own you could create your own list of worms youve made and name if you want.  '),4

You can play in battle, mode agenced two to four people or you can just play for fun and play for fun and earn coins to the new song and you can also earn diamonds to be special songs.

If you hit the key after the sound plays you get perfect if you hit when the sound should play you get great cool.

In most other games like this you can be silent and I understand the prone sound but crouching you could be so silent in real life or maybe a button to make you silent but slower kinda like the sprint button.

You can train troops and attack other villages to get gold, but beware other people will attack you too so you have to defend your base.

Gets your steps up as well so can't complain there! I think this is better for people who live in the city due to the amount of pokestops, gyms, and the tracking system being linked to pokestops so if you live in a more rural area it's a lot harder as there's less pokestops about and you have to keep driving to places of interest to top up on everything. Also, when it's refreshing, sometimes it takes time and you end up with a blank nearby list with no PokÌÄå©mon around you for a little while before it all loads.
