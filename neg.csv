Recent update reformabts the screen that shows game progress and looks to me a lot like a board game, also adds a bunch of moving effects that are completely unnecessary and are actually distracting. Constant prompts to buy coinsNot sure I like the app at all now  ')",2

14,First im not spending money on upgrades if i cant upgradethru earning them in battle i have ove 300k and cant spend any of it to unlock better ships or weapons ive.

17,"It is set up so that its brightness does not match the phone's brightness for some reason. Playing right before bed? Get ready for a nice, bright light in your eyes because you played 6 hours ago. Also, there are a lot of ads between games and it eats through your battery very quickly. Edit to respond: the fact you change brightness in the app IS THE PROBLEM. Just make it the brightness the phone is.  "")",3
18,"Cool game, great material design! Everything is great but the fact that you have to pay $3 to get rid of the excessively common ads. There should be something else that comes with no ads, because I am not going to waste $3 on a game just to get rid of ads. I am just going to delete it. At this point, I am going to play ""Missiles!"". It is much more developed and has little ads. The no ads in-app purchase is not going to get you any money!  ')",3
24,"My honest opinion is that not much work was put into this game which is made obvious by the controls and animation. One thing I don't like is how they thought it was ok to pack it with adds. If this game was better as far as animation and controls I would have appreciated it more. Other than that the game was ok. To be completely honest I think I made something similar for extra credit in my coding class in 8th grade.  "")",3
26,"For the second time all the progress I made has been deleted. Everytime I have total magnet, star power, backpack filled the game resets itself start glitching. I about over this game. It is super frustrating to start all over. I couldn't even login to my Facebook fooling with this app. It's about that time to free some space by deleting this app.  "")",1
27,Great game. Adds are a bit too frequent in free version. Uninstalled for this reason. Devs please change frequency of Adds for better rating. I personally never purchase any App no matter how good if the free version is crippled by Adds. I should be able to enjoy it for a while and purchase to get cool paid only  features!  '),3
29,"For a game that you can't win, this one is very addictive. It freezes a lot, which is part of why you can't get far. If you upgrade the shooter or power, the initial blocks get higher numbers which really sucks. You should be able to get further along when you upgrade your shooter :-/ So, two stars. It quickly loses it's entertainment value when you just can't get ahead.  "")",2

41,"Its kind of annoiying how many pop ads come up and how some choices require gems. But I get it,a free app has to do what a free has to do. I like the graphics though I sometimes wonder who in the world dances and runs like that. In short: really awkward to look at. On top of that the dialogue's pretty corny.

And too be a premium player is $120 a year,  that\'s more than Netflix And Netflix doesn\'t have commercials!  And more ads on here than a Superbowl game.

51,I loved the previous version and was addicted to it. But the new version is bad!  Bad things about the new version: - Lifting effect disturbing (3D effects in general)  - Block is not blurred when it does not fit in the board - Slow performance when game over  Please revert back to previous version!!!

54,"I've been playing this game for a few days, so here's my review. I enjoy the stories even though they use a lot of archetypes, and I don't mind waiting for keys. The biggest issue I have is with the gems and premium choices: not only do the premium choices cost an unreasonably high amount of gems, but every time there are choice options with at least one premium choice, the premium choices are always presented as the better ones. This is less like making my own choices and more like reaffirming my assumption that the premium choices are always the better ones. I've come to the conclusion that I would rather pay once to have this app installed rather than install it for free and pay money for gems just so I could pick the premium choices.  "")",3
56,"Game is fun to play per say. What really ruins it, is the constant need to purchase rubies. Nothing but a money pit. If you got as many rubies as you did coins game would be more fair and fun. Also there's maybe two things  you can buy with coins. Butf course that would take money out of your pocket. Of course energy =purchase w/rubies or quit playing let energy build. Love the game just limited energy, then have to build up energy. (I refuse to buy anymore rubies, so I'm just limited on what I can do since everything has high energy requirements.  "")",3

58,"This game IS NOT FREE. Sure you can download for free, then you can play a few games for free, then if you want to get better ... Guess what.... you have to pay. Then as you get better you have opponents that are WAY out of your league so that you have to spend your gems (which cost money... A LOT of money to purchase. Then guess what... More opponents out of your league, and you have crosswords, while they have a nice light tail wind , from the same tee box.

62,The reason I hate this is beacuse some miscreants are using this and other games to make users install it in exchange of getting a link to ios animoji apk for Android. Both games are from igg. That means either they are promoting their game through fake marketing or they are paying somebody to do so.  '),1
65,"I installed this a couple of days ago and love it but you are soon restricted and can't do much unless you want to buy and spend money. It's a lot of money too in the long run and bit worth it.

74,"Great timewaster! There are a lot of characters to earn and you don't need to spend real money to get them, so that's a plus. However, rated it a 3 cuz there are sooooo many ads. I get that ads generate the revenue to keep a good game free but an ad populates for literally every action.

You open one of the tabs in the game and you get to watch one. Then there are 3 different booster and you have to watch an ad to activate those and one only last 60 second.

My 7 year old daughter & I play together. Definitely not appropriate for kids to be playing &hearing. When the inappropriate  adds stop I'll change my rating .

Getting new vehicle is different this time, you have to play and win a whole bunch in the new ""race"" mode. In the old game, you could just buy the car you wanted when you had the money available.

Because the screen froze first i tapped the screen to see if it would work but app shut down.. i dont know why but i have been charged 129.99.. not once but twice.. it has got to be linked to the app crashes.. i would never spend that much ever especially of gems for a game which by the way after i saw that u had taken money from my account i went into the game and there defiantly werent 4000 gems there. So either way something has gone terribly wrong and im out of pocket $260 on a day that it was suppose to be used for my kids..the money you took put of my account was all i had saved to pay for school fees for my kids.. i have sent various emails to you guys please requesting a refund on both of the transactions you have taken out of my account over the past 6 or more hours as i need my money back asap please. Thank you for your swift action in fixing the issue.  '),1
1724,"The game in all is ok, but it\'s the account management I find difficult since I tried to claim the gift after some time re-installing this app. I\'ve always found blizzard page to be ""Not found"" and this is a problem for me wanting to enjoy the game. I\'ve the verifications and codes and tried logging out and in, but NOTHING seems to work, or at least so far what I can think of, so Blizzard, please! Awnser this! I enjoy playing this game as much as I enjoy any other card game. Otherwise I would\'ve wasted those two hours waiting for nothing but a huge let down. Thank you.  ')",3

1739,"I think the game could definitely use some upgrading.  When you clear a scene or when you level up your energy isn't replenished.  And when you want to play more that is when they try to have you buy stuff.  I can day though this is one of the games that don't have a ton of ads.  When you complete a board you don't have to watch the entire as which is a super plus and the only reason why it is still on my phone.  So. It definitely has its perks.  If you change the fact of getting energy when you level up I will give it five stars.  I think the game would be perfect and I might even want to buy something.  However the fact of not getting energy when you level up is ludicrous  "")",2

1787,Card control is poor for the playtime allotted.  Card randomized is very unrealistic. Best bet is to play the discards. The percentage of middle or lower cards to the high end off the pile is very very unreal. Fun game though I just would never pay a penny for anything add out is not realistic card play.  '),3
